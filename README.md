Polygraphic rewriting
=====================

This is a tentative implementation of
[polygraphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygraph_(mathematics)) and
associated rewriting procedures. The representation is discussed in
_[Implementing
polygraphs](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Samuel.Mimram/docs/mimram_polyimpl_slides.pdf)_
and is only expected to be faithful for a subclass of polygraphs
(e.g. [non-unital ones](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00744)).
